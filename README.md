EDA Kaggle practice dataset
<p>Hello and welcome to my GitHub repository where I share my experience working with a dataset using AutoViz for data visualization. As a beginner in the field of data science, I found AutoViz to be an extremely helpful tool for visualizing the dataset.

The first step in my project was data preparation. I had to clean the data, handle missing values, and remove irrelevant columns. This process was necessary to ensure that the data was of high quality and accurate.

Next, I used AutoViz to visualize the data. AutoViz is an easy-to-use tool that automatically generates various charts and graphs from the dataset, without the need for coding. I found this tool to be very helpful as it saved me a lot of time and effort, especially as a beginner.

In this repository, you will find the code that I used for data preparation and visualization. The readme file provides a brief overview of the project and how to run the code. I hope my experience using AutoViz will be useful to other beginners in the field of data science who are looking for a simple and effective tool for data visualization.</p>
