EDA Kaggle practice dataset
<p>Hello and welcome to my GitHub repository where I share my experience working with a dataset using AutoViz for data visualization. As a beginner in the field of data science, I found AutoViz to be an extremely helpful tool for visualizing the dataset.

The first step in my project was data preparation. I had to clean the data, handle missing values, and remove irrelevant columns. This process was necessary to ensure that the data was of high quality and accurate.

Next, I used AutoViz to visualize the data. AutoViz is an easy-to-use tool that automatically generates various charts and graphs from the dataset, without the need for coding. I found this tool to be very helpful as it saved me a lot of time and effort, especially as a beginner.

In this repository, you will find the code that I used for data preparation and visualization. The readme file provides a brief overview of the project and how to run the code. I hope my experience using AutoViz will be useful to other beginners in the field of data science who are looking for a simple and effective tool for data visualization.</p>

Here is a brief overview of the project and instructions on how to run the code:

Project overview:

  1. This project involves working with a dataset preparing the data by cleaning it and handling missing values and then visualizing it using AutoViz.

  2. The code provided in this repository includes Python scripts for data preparation and data visualization using AutoViz.
  
Instructions to run the code:

  1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
  2. Make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed, including pandas, numpy, and autoviz.
  3. Open the Jupyter notebook file "Data_Visualization_with_AutoViz.ipynb" in your Jupyter Notebook environment.
  4. Run the notebook cell by cell to see the data preparation process, as well as the AutoViz visualizations.
  5. Feel free to modify the code to work with your own dataset or experiment with different visualization settings in AutoViz.
  
That's it! I hope this project and the code provided are useful for anyone looking to learn more about data preparation and visualization using AutoViz.
